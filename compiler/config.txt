        Normally when you are going to build a version of the compiler
        you need to go through the CONFIG.H file to ensure that the
        options are all set as you want them to be for this build.
        There are a number of files that are provided for building
        specific variants of the compiler to stop you having to
        work out for yourself what are valid options within the
        CONFIG.H file.

        CONFIG.CHK      Version of CONFIG.H that is used when building
                        a Psion 3a/3c version of the compiler that
                        only supports syntax checking (no code generation)

        CONFIG.GEN      Version of CONFIG.H that is used when building
                        a Psion 3a/3c version of the compiler that
                        does support code generation.

        CONFIG.C86      Version of CONFIG.H that is used under Linux or
                        Windows 95/NT when generating a version of the
                        compiler that is to act as a cross-compiler for
                        the Psion 3a/3c.


        In addition there are a number of ancillary files that are used
        when building special versions of the compiler:

        CONFIG.BAT      MSDOS Batch file used to build Psion 3a/3c
                        versions of the compiler. Ensures that correct
                        CONFIG.??? file is copied to CONFIG.H prior to
                        building the compiler.

        C86.C           Special file used to generate the C86.RSS file
                        when building Psion 3a/3c hosted version of the
                        compiler.

        C86.MAK         Files that are used when building a version of
        C86.MDP         the compiler using Visual C++ that is to act as
                        a cross-compiler for the Psion 3a/3c.
