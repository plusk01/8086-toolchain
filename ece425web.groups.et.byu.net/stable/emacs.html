Why use Emacs?  Let me quote from the Preface to Bob Glickstein's
book <i> Writing GNU Emacs Extensions </i>:

<blockquote>
Before you even begin to extend Emacs, it's already the
highest-function text editor there is.  Not only can it do everything
you'd normally expect (formatting paragraphs, centering lines,
searching for patterns, putting a block in upper case), not only does
it have advanced features (matching braces in source code, employing
color to highlight syntactic elements in your files, giving online
help on every keystroke and other commands), but it also performs a
host of functions you'd never dream of finding in a text editor.  You
can use Emacs to read and compose email and to browse the World Wide
Web; you can have it run FTP for you, transparently making remote files
editable as if they were local; you can ask it to remind you about
upcoming meetings, appointments, and anniversaries.  As if that
weren't enough, Emacs can also play you in a game of Go-Moku (and win,
more than likely); it can tell you today's date in the ancient Mayan
calendar; and it can decompose a number into its prime factors.
</blockquote><p>

Emacs is powerful, self-documenting, customizable, and extensible
editor.  When you consider that it is free and readily available on
Unix systems (and free and downloadable for Windows also), it is hard
to beat. While it is not the easiest editor in the world to learn your
way around, I think you will find that the rewards easily justify the
effort, and not just for the Go-Moku. <p>

You can easily find any number of online emacs tutorials.  Note also
that emacs has its complete manual available on-line in Info.  After
you understand the basics, try typing C-h i (while holding the control
key down, push h, then release both and press i) to get started with
the on-line documentation.  <p>

Have fun!
