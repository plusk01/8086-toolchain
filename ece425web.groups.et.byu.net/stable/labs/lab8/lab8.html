<hr>
<h3>Overview</h3>

You are expected to complete this lab with a partner.  In this lab you
will write application code that makes use of your YAK kernel and
interacts with Simptris, a Tetris-like game with significant time
constraints.  Conceptually, you are writing the code for an embedded,
real-time system that will connect to and control another machine
running the Simptris game.  Your system is notified via interrupts
when new pieces appear on the screen and your code must call functions
that shift and rotate each piece as it falls so that you continue to
clear lines.  The shift and rotate functions have a fixed overhead
that becomes the bottleneck; as the pieces come faster and fall
faster, sooner or later you won't be able to move a piece before it
touches down. <p>

The purpose of this lab is to give you experience in writing
time-critical application code that runs with your YAK kernel.  This
is not a class in artificial intelligence, and you are not required to
devise a complicated placement strategy.  A reasonably straightforward
playing approach is sufficient to clear the number of lines required
for this lab. (For those who are not content with just satisfying the
minimum requirement, we will have a little contest near the end of the
semester with Twinkies awarded to the high scores.)<p>

<h3>Simptris Details</h3>

Simptris is an extension of the simulator.  To run put the simulator
into simptris mode, enter the command<b>
</b>'<samp>simptris</samp>'. A new window entitled "Simptris" should
appear. The box in this window is the game display. Normal text output
from your program will still be displayed in the program output
window.<p>

With some exceptions, the basic rules of Tetris apply to this game.
For simplicity, the game board is smaller and the pieces consist of
three blocks instead of four.  There are only two possible shapes: a
"straight" piece and a "corner" piece.  More than one piece may be
falling at the same time, but they will never fall side by side or be
close enough to run into each other as they are being turned.  As the
number of lines increases, both the rate at which pieces fall and the
frequency of their appearance increase as more lines are cleared.  The
score is simply the number of lines cleared and is displayed at the
bottom of the Simptris window; there is no bonus for clearing multiple
lines with one piece.<p>

The game board is 6 units wide and 16 units deep.  The upper three
rows are a special buffer in which new pieces will appear.  You can
move pieces as soon as they appear in this buffer, but the game ends
when a piece touches down with any part of it still in the top three
rows.  The columns are numbered 0-5 from left to right, and the rows
are numbered 0-15 from bottom to top.<p>

The type, placement, and orientation of each piece is generated
randomly, but you can (and should) use the appropriate function to
seed the random number generator, ensuring that you will see the same
sequence of pieces to help with debugging.  (If you notice that the
behavior of your code is not the same every time you execute with the
same seed, please inform a TA or the instructor.)  When passing off
the program you may use any seed you wish; for our friendly
competition a particular seed will be selected at random.<p>

To communicate with your application code, Simptris uses several
different interrupts. You will need to write an ISR for every possible
interrupt.  Normally, if you wanted to ignore a certain interrupt, you
would disable it by appropriately setting the IMR in the PIC. However,
for this lab, if your simptris code does not need to handle a certain
interrupt, create an ISR for it that contains just the iret
instruction.<p>

<h4>Interrupts</h4>

From a (simulated) hardware perspective, the reset, tick, and keypress
interrupts are unchanged from previous labs.  However, you are free to
modify your interrupt handlers for these interrupts in any way you
wish, so long as the requirements for this lab are met.  (In other
words, no specific output is required in the keypress or tick ISRs or
handlers.)

<p> Here is a table listing all possible interrupts that can be
generated in Simptris:

<p>

Please note that you must write and set up an ISR for <i>all</i>
interrupts. If you do not intend to use one of the interrupts, then
the ISR for that interrupt should simply send the EOI command and then
iret. Don't forget to save and restore the registers that are used by
the EOI command (usually AX). Here is a brief description of the new
interrupts:

<ul>

<li><b>Game Over (IRQ 3)</b>.  Indicates that the game is over.  No
  new pieces will appear.

<li><b>New Piece (IRQ 4)</b>. Indicates that a new piece has appeared
  on the board. When this interrupt occurs, information can be
  obtained about the pieces by reading variables declared in
  clib.s. The ID of the new piece (required as a parameter in the
  functions that move pieces) is stored in
  <b><samp>NewPieceID</samp></b>, the type of piece is stored in
  <b><samp>NewPieceType</samp></b>, its orientation is stored in
  <b><samp>NewPieceOrientation</samp></b>, and its column (the corner
  block on corner pieces and the center block on straight pieces) is
  in <b><samp>NewPieceColumn</samp></b>.  The row for new pieces is
  always row 14. More details on accessing and interpreting these
  variables will be given shortly.&nbsp;

<li><b>Received Command (IRQ 5)</b>.  This indicates that Simptris
  <i>received</i> the last command that was sent and that a new
  command (shift or rotate) can be sent.  This interrupt is generated
  by the simulator after a fixed delay from the sending of the
  previous command.  You should never send a command until this
  interrupt has been received for the previous command; if you do,
  your second command will overwrite the parameters of the first and
  just generally mess things up. You should not interpret this
  interrupt as an indication that the previous command was executed
  successfully; for example, if you try to rotate a straight piece
  that is against the side, nothing will happen, but you will still
  get this interrupt after the specified delay indicating that the
  "channel" is clear to send the next command.

<li><b>Touchdown (IRQ 6)</b>.  This indicates that a piece has landed
  on something and therefore stopped falling.  The ID of the piece is
  found in the global variable <b><samp>TouchdownID</samp></b>. Each
  time this interrupt occurs, a bitmap of the new screen after the
  touchdown (ignoring pieces that are still falling) is contained in
  the word sized variables <b><samp>ScreenBitMap0, ScreenBitMap1,
  ScreenBitMap2, ScreenBitMap3, ScreenBitMap4,</samp></b> and
  <b><samp>ScreenBitMap5</samp></b>.  Each of these represents (in order from
  left to right) one column.  Of the 16-bits in each variable, the MSB
  corresponds to the lowest row, and the LSB corresponds the highest
  row.  A bit value of 1 means that the corresponding square on the
  game board is occupied and a 0 means that the space is vacant.

<li><b>Line Clear (IRQ 7)</b>. This indicates that a line has been
  cleared in Simptris.  If a piece cleared more than one line, only
  one interrupt is generated.

</ul><p>

<h4> Accessing and Interpreting the Variables </h4>

All variables in the description above correspond to word-size
locations reserved in the clib.s file.  You can easily access these
variables in your C code by declaring each as an "<samp>extern
unsigned</samp>" and then referencing it normally, just as you did
with the <samp>KeyBuffer</samp> variable in previous labs. <P>

Values of variables not fully explained above are interpreted as
follows: <p>

<ul>

<li> <b><samp>NewPieceType</samp></b>.  This has value 1 for straight
  pieces and value 0 for corner pieces.<p>

<li> <b><samp>NewPieceOrientation</samp></b>.  The value is
  interpreted as shown below.  The red block (<font
  color=red>*</font>) shown here is the "center" block of the piece.
  Remember that the value of <samp>NewPieceColumn</samp> is always
  that of this center block, and a piece always rotates around its
  center block.  (In other words, the center block doesn't move when
  you rotate a piece).<p>

Corner Pieces:
<blockquote>
<pre>0    1    2    3
<font color=blue>
*     *   *<font color=red>*   *</font>*
<font color=red>*</font>*   *<font color=red>*</font>    *   *
</pre>
  </blockquote>
</font><p>

Straight Pieces:
<blockquote>
<pre>  0   1
<font color=blue>
      *
 *<font color=red>*</font>*  <font color=red>*</font>
      *</pre>
  </blockquote>
</font>
<p>
</ul><p>

<h4>Control Functions</h4>

These functions are used to move the pieces and actually play the
game.  <b>In order to use these functions, you must include the file
<a href="../library/simptris.s">simptris.s</a> which provides function
declarations.</b> You may also include <a
href="../library/simptris.h">simptris.h</a>, which provides headers
for these functions. Consider the functions in simptris.s part of a
"standard library" that is used to communicate with Simptris.  (You
should not modify these functions for this lab.)<p>

<ul>

<li><samp>void <b>SlidePiece</b>(int ID, int direction)</samp>
  <br>This will slide the piece specified by <em>ID</em> one space to
  the right (<em>direction</em> = 1) or to the left
  (<em>direction</em> = 0).  No action will be taken if the piece
  cannot move in the specified direction without running into a wall
  or fallen pieces or if the piece in question has already touched
  down.

<p><li><samp>void <b>RotatePiece</b>(int ID, int direction)</samp>
  <br>This will rotate the piece specified by <em>ID</em> 90 degrees
  in a clockwise direction (<em>direction</em> = 1) or a
  counter-clockwise direction (<em>direction</em> = 0).  If the piece
  cannot rotate without colliding with a wall or an occupied square,
  no action will be taken.

</ul>

<p>Both of the above functions use software interrupts to pass the
information to Simptris. The actual code that is executed for the
software interrupts is hidden from you but you are free to look at
simptris.s to see how the software interrupt routines are called.
There is some delay between the time these functions are called and
when Simptris actually performs the requested command. This simulates
a transmission and execution delay and makes the game far more
interesting for our purposes.  After the delay, Simptris will read the
parameters from memory and respond with a <strong>received command
(IRQ 5)</strong> interrupt.  Only at this point in time can the next
command be sent.

<ul>
<p>

<li><samp>void <b>SeedSimptris</b>(long seed)</samp> <br>This seeds
  the random number generator.  There is no delay associated with this
  function, and Simptris will <b>not</b> respond with a received
  command interrupt when this function is called.  You should call
  this function before calling StartSimptris(), and you may not call
  it more than once in the execution of each program. Subsequent calls
  will be ignored.<p>

<li><samp>void <b>StartSimptris</b>(void)</samp> <br>This tells
  Simptris to start the game.  Before this command is issued, no
  pieces will fall in the Simptris window.  This will allow you to do
  the needed "idle runs" in your application to track CPU usage before
  you have to worry about moving pieces.  There is no delay associated
  with this function, and Simptris will <b>not</b> respond with a
  received command interrupt when it receives this command.

</ul>

<p>

<h3>Requirements</h3>

<p> Your application code must meet the following requirements:

<ul>

<li> It must make use of your YAK kernel, using the functions you have
written for other labs.  You may optimize these functions, but they
should not be customized to the point that they will not work with the
application code of previous labs.

<li> For full credit, your code must clear at least <b>200 lines</b>
at the default tick frequency (a tick every 10,000 instructions).  For
every 40 lines that you fall short of 200, the maximum credit you can
receive is reduced by 10%. (You can receive up to 90% of the full
points for this lab by clearing 160 lines; up to 80% by clearing 120
lines, etc.) You may select any single seed you want to meet this
requirement.

<li> It must accurately report context switches and CPU utilization
once every 20 clock ticks. These values <b>must</b> be displayed in
decimal and <b>must</b> be displayed each time on a line by themselves
<b>exactly in the form shown below</b>, where # is respectively the
number of context switches and percent CPU usage.

<b><pre>&lt;CS: #, CPU: #&gt;</pre></b>

</ul>

When the kernel runs the application code correctly, show and demonstrate your
code to a TA. <b>Since you must demonstrate working code to a TA on or before the due date, please
consider their lab schedule well in advance</b>.<p>

In addition to the demonstration, you must a written summary of
problems you encountered, if any, in completing this lab.  You should
also include a report of the number of hours you spent on the lab,
including coding and debugging. A realistic estimate is
sufficient. Send a submission even if you didn't encounter any
noteworthy bugs along the way. In your submission, include the number
of lines your application code was able to clear. <b>You will not
receive full credit for the lab unless you send a report.</b><p>

<font color=red>New for Fall 2019: we want both your report and your
source code for the lab.  The easiest way to do this is to create a
report file (for consistency call it report.txt or report.pdf), to add
it to the working directory for the lab, to create a compressed tar
file (with all the files in your directory), and then to upload that
file to Learning Suite. <p>

To review, if 425/labx is your working directory for this lab, type
the following in the 425 directory: 

<blockquote><pre> tar -cvzf submission.tar.gz labx
</pre></blockquote>

and then upload the resulting compressed tar file (submission.tar.gz)
to Learning Suite.</font>

<p>

<h3>Important Notes and Recommendations</h3>

<p> You should study the application programs from previous labs for
insight into how your code should be organized.  If you cannot think
of an obviously better way of organizing your code, it is recommended
that you organize your code as follows: Create multiple tasks; one
will handle the arrival of new pieces and then call a placement
function for new corner pieces and a different placement function for
new straight pieces.  A second task is dedicated to communication with
Simptris, and a third task tracks statistics.  After lab 6, you should
see obvious benefits of using a queue to communicate between the tasks
that handle new pieces and the task that communicates with Simptris.
You could use semaphores, queues, or events to allow ISRs to
communicate the new piece details with the task(s) handling piece
placement.<p>

Even if you want to maximize your score, start with a simple placement
algorithm.  The approach described below is straightforward and works
quite well.  As you code it up, you'll think of some optimizations you
can make, but get the simpler approach working first.

   <ul>
   <li> Conceptually divide the 6 columns into two bins, each 3 wide.
   <li> Always play straight pieces flat, and make sure that at least
        one of your bins can handle a straight piece at all times.
   <li> Play corner pieces in the outside columns when bins are flat.
   <li> If a bin is not flat, even it up with the next corner piece.
   <li> Even up the bins by playing on the low side when feasible.
   </ul><p>

The fastest placement algorithms are fairly simple. Don't spend an
excessive amount of time writing and debugging an extremely complex
algorithm for piece placement only to find that it performs poorly.<p>

Don't put this lab off to the end. Here is a statistical summary of
hours reported per team to complete this lab in Fall 2017:

<ul>
   <li> Low: 3.5
   <li> High: 20.0
   <li> Average: 9.0
</ul>

<p>

<h3> Known bugs/features </h3>

When you clear a line, the pieces above that line fall no further than
the line that was cleared.  In other words, stuff above the line won't
fall down into a hole and cause additional lines to be cleared.  If
your playing algorithm relies on this functionality, you'd better
rethink it. <p>

The actual number of lines you clear depends to some extent on the
load on the machine you are running on.  This is certainly less than
ideal, and something you need to be aware of.  Run your code again,
and try a machine that has fewer active processes on it.<P>

<h3> Debugging help </h3>

Here are comments from student reports describing their problems on
this lab and how they tracked them down.  As always, take them with a
grain of salt. Also, if you notice any problems or inconsistencies
with Simptris or Emu86, please contact a TA immediately so that the
problem can be fixed.

<ul>

<li>Our "clearToSend" semaphore initially started out as 0; the
program never sent messages to simptris until we started it out as 1.

<li>We weren't using the received command interrupt.  Because we
weren't waiting for a command to finish, we sent commands that
overwrote the previous ones.  Thus, some pieces would rotate or slide,
while others would not.

<li>We also did not take into account initially the column being 0 or
5, which would require a slide before any rotation.


<li> We encountered one big problem which caused simptris to only
place one block into position before it crashed.  It took us quite a
while to determine the problem.  We originally thought that the
problem occurred in our YAK kernel, but we also felt that it worked.
We finally tracked the problem down to where we initialized our first
task in the main function of our application code.  We had two tasks
using the same stack.  After we corrected this, we encountered a few
minor errors, but nothing difficult to track down.

<li> We had a kernel bug actually in YKQPost.  This was kind of weird
because lab 6 didn't catch it at all.  It was simply an if statement
where we accidentally put only one = instead of ==.  It took us a bit
to track that down, but we found it.

<li> We had some problems with our algorithm.  We had lots of bugs in
it because we kind of coded it off the top of our heads, then tried to
fix it when it didn't work.  Every time we'd fix one bug, we
introduced another so that it took quite a bit of time to fix all the
bugs.

<li> We didn't mask unwanted interrupts correctly and occasionally one
of these would cause crashes.

<li> We had a delay statement in our piece solving algorithm which
really slowed things down.

<li> We weren't resetting some of the values in our messages so that
when the queue was overwritten and we read some of the values in our
communication task they were incorrect.  We had a problem with some of
our logic and recognizing correctly the bitmap correspondence.  We
fixed this bug and got it taken care of.  Our semaphore function had
some problems.  It worked fine for lab5 but gave us problems in this
lab. We fixed it.

<li> Initially, we tried to minimize the number of moves required for
any given piece. this invloved mixing straight and corner pieces on
both sides of the board. This proved difficult to do, so we switched
to a variation on the "straight on one side, corners on the other"
approach. Now, all pieces would fit correctly, and we were limited
only by the overhead of our kernel.

<li> One of the major problems we had with this program was trying to
find the lowest point in the graph.  I spent a long time trying to
figure out the best way to do it.  I tried to reverse the order of the
bits so I could do a simple compare on the values to see where the
lowest point was on the board.  However Dr. Archibald suggested using
a value that I set every time I placed A piece.  This turned out to
work very well and only required me to change two lines to the code I
had written previously.  The other problem I had was I was turning the
pieces when they were against the edge and so I had to move them away
from the edge first.  Another one of my problems was in finding steps
to place my corners.  I simply had my compare values backwards.

<li> We encountered some problems because we downloaded a fresh
version of the clib.s file and we forgot to put the entries into the
interrupt vector table.  We ended up trying to debug this error for
about an hour.  We had some trouble with placing pieces and we tried
to make our app code too smart.  When we "toned" it down a bit, things
seemed to work a lot better.

<li> One bug that took us a long time to find was that in our ISRs for
the simptris interrupts, we weren't writing the EOI command before
calling YKExitISR, which caused us to ignore all subsequent lower
priority interrupts than the first one that did this (NewTask in our
case). Also, we failed to save the stack pointer in the ISRs at the
top of our context like we did in our other ISRs, so that took a while
to track down.  The rest was just working out the details of our
algorithm.

<li> Our biggest bug was left over from last labs YKQPost!!  The
compiler did not catch the fact that in one case it did not return a
value!!  This meant we took as a return value whatever happened to be
in register ax.  For last weeks lab it worked out, this week it did
not though.  We got a return that we were overflowing even though we
were not!!

<li> The main problem I encountered was trying to rely on the bitmap
for piece placement. This turned out to not work after about 39 lines
on any seed because I had to wait until pieces touched down to make
the decision on my next piece. After about 39 lines the pieces were
falling to fast to effectively make the decisions and changes by
waiting on the other piece to land. Also I found small bugs in my
algorithm, mostly dealing with pieces against either of the side
walls.

<li> Since this was the first lab that we actually wrote yak
application code, it was the first time I had used YKNewTask
firsthand.  I set up my tasks and made stacks for them.  I gave them
plenty of stack space, actually too much stack space.  I think I ran
off the segment.  Things were really weird with the huge stacks but
worked normally when I made my stacks smaller.

<li> My original algorithm that would place pieces in a more random
fashion. It was smart.  It would look for a suitable spot and place
the piece. It worked great when there was enough time to maneuver the
piece into place after the piece before had touched down.  The problem
came when there were multiple pieces and close together.  Since the
algorithm needed to know everything about the pieces that were played,
it couldn't move two pieces at once.  Rather than make a complicated
algorithm even more complicated, I just started fresh with left/right
flat straight piece algorithm.  The second algorithm cleared 199
lines.  Lesson learned: simple/dumb sometimes works better than
complicated/smart.<p>
