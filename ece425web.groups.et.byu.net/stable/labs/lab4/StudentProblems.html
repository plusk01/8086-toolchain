<h2>Student Problem List</h2>

Below is a list of problems that students ran into during previous
semesters while completing lab 4 (parts B, C, and D). Reading through the list may
help you avoid these same problems.

<ul>

<li> At first, I initialized stack values for
  new tasks to be all 0's.  But when I was verifing that the stack was
  getting written to the correct location, I wanted to put a non-zero
  value into the stack locations.  I assumed that wouldn't hurt
  anything.  I left CS at 0 but I ignorantly assigned DS to be 1.
  What did that do?  It added 16 to the address of any reference to
  the data segment.  I was thrown off the trail because it looked like
  I was just getting bad reads from memory and I couldn't figure out
  why. 

<li> We used the -= operator, and it ended up with sub ax, -18h  when the c said -= 18h,  thus it added instead of subtracted, and it took a lot of debugging to figure out that it wasn't our fault.  We fixed the problem by using x = x - 18h and it worked correctly.

  <li> The c86 compiler was saying "TERMINATING: - signal 11 received"
when it tried to compile my yakc.i.  We had the TCB and TCBptr
typedefs BELOW a function prototype that used TCBptr as an argument.
Once we moved the typedefs above the function prototypes, we didn't
have any more problems.  

  <li> We forgot that declarations of variables have to happen at the
beginning of a scope (i.e. before function calls).  Otherwise, you get
strange behavior.  

   <li> We inserted the TCB into a sorted list before assigning the
task its priority--this caused everything to have a priority of 0
(which caused our "insert" function to stop working).  

   <li> We attempted to do more than necessary for this lab--we
thought that YKEnterISR and YKExitISR were required, and they were
giving us trouble.  But then were told that we didn't have to do them
for this lab--we'll do them next time.

  <li>We copied and pasted Dr. Archibalds linked list code and it came back 
  to bite us.  We understood the code, but made the assumption it worked for 
  all the cases we needed.  In the code that puts a task back into the ready 
  list from the suspend list, we had to set the prev pointer back to 0 if it 
  was going to the front of the list.

  <li>We had to make sure that the scheduler was not called until after YKRun was 
  called.  That means that YKExitISR shouldn't call it. The fix meant that at 
  the beginning of scheduler we checked a global variable that was set once 
  YKRun was called...if it hadn't been set we simply returned from YKScheduler 
  without doing anything.

  <li>We forgot to update our #define for MAXTASKS after part B - easy fix.

  <li>We ran into an iret problem because we were taking care of some business 
  before pushing our flags onto the stack.  This was remedied by pushing the 
  iret stuff on and moving it to replace the code that was in the first few lines.

  <li>We were pushing bp on the stack instead of [bp] in the dispatcher, 
  which was not allowing us to roll out of the scheduler. 

  <li>The biggest error we had was that we called YKExitISR at the end of our 
  interrupt handler rather than right after the EOI command.

  <li>We forgot that the first time you call YKScheduler from YKRun you don’t 
  have to save context. If you do, you end up saving the YKRun’s context over 
  the TCB of your first task.</li>

  <li>We passed in a pointer to the bottom of the stack rather than to the top 
  of the stack when creating our idle task. This caused problems. </li>

  <li>In YKNewTask we set up a char pointer pointing to the top of the stack and 
  when we set things up on the stack the indexes were not words, but bytes.</li>

  <li>After spending 20 hours on this part of the lab, one hint I'd give future 
  students: make sure your dispatcher is doing EXACTLY what you think it's doing 
  before you mess with your other code too much.</li>

  <li>The clib.h doesn't have NULL defined and we had to determine how to define 
  NULL</li>

  <li>All of our problems revolved around setting up the stack for each task in 
  YKNewTask and properly pushing and popping on the correct stack when in 
  YKDispatcher. To solve the problems, we put breakpoints at YKNewTask and 
  YKDispatcher, then looked at a dump of the stack at certain points to make 
  sure the correct information was being pushed/popped and in the right order. 
  Drawing out the stack frame for each task helped as well.</li>

  <li>Pointers in assembly. Make sure you really dereference them. Or 
  vise-versa. Symptoms were usually overwritten memory. Especially with strings 
  to be printed.</li>

  <li>Declared variables in middle of functions rather than top. That did weird 
  things. DON’T DO THAT !!!!</li>

  <li>The only major problem we encountered was with our dispatcher. We kept on 
  dispatching functions with the stack pointed to one value higher than it 
  should have been. The problem was that we forgot to account for the IP that 
  was pushed onto the stack when dispatcher was called.</li>

  <li>The most difficult thing to implement was saving and restoring state. We 
  figured out that we could save state of the current running task first thing 
  in the dispatcher, than restore state of the task it's switching to right 
  after. This way when a task is restored it will restore and return to the 
  scheduler, since it is what called the dispatcher, then return to the task, or 
  whatever called the scheduler.</li>

  <li>We forgot to add ret statements to EnterMutex and ExitMutex minor bug, but 
  took a minute to figure it out.</li>

  <li>We traversed our entire TCB array (of 100 TCBs) everytime the tick ISR was 
  called to decrement all the delayed tasks. This took so long that when we 
  lowered the tick delay to 750, the tick ISR ran continuously.</li>

  <li>When dealing with the interrupts, we didn't think to use the same clib.s 
  file as we used in lab 3. Because of this, when an interrupt happened, code 
  starting executing at the interrupt table.</li>

  <li>Getting the code to execute properly with ticks at 750. It seemed that 
  interrupts were not being reenabled after Task C started to run. What really 
  happened was that when YKNewTask was called to create the TCB and context for 
  Task C, it was interrupted by the tick before it could be properly setup, and 
  then it was restored by the YKDispatcher with incorrect context. Thus, the key 
  to making sure tick interrupts were enabled was to DISABLE interrupts at the 
  beginning of YKNewTask! </li>

<li> My scheduler has to search for the highest priority task.  It was
failing to do so correctly because I didn't initialize my highest
priority TCB pointer correctly.  To fix it, I had to initially set my
highest priority task pointer to a dummy TCB whose priority was lower
than the idle task (a value higher than the idle task) so that my
search algorithm would always find the idle task even if nothing else
was on the list.</li>

<li> Our problem list:
  <ol>
  <li> Our CS register was being modified without us knowing, throwing
       the location of the instructions into a non-existent place in
       memory.  We changed a lot of code because this indicated that
       our stack pointer was off.  When we restored context, a weird
       value was put into CS instead of the value it should have been:
       0x0000.

  </li><li> In our tick isr we weren't being as careful as we should have
       been with replacing the pointers in the doubly linked list of
       TCBs.  We made sure that we disabled and enabled interrupts
       around the transfer between lists as well as making sure that
       we weren't making any TCBs null.

  </li><li> Our idle task was taken out of the ready list and put into the
       suspended list when it shouldn't have been.  We changed that by
       changing how we moved things from the suspended list to the
       ready list.

  </li><li> We had difficulty setting up the initial stack of each task.
       We used the dummy stack, then switched to just creating a small
       stack of values to stick on each stack when we initialized each
       new task.  We had to be very careful with our stack pointer in
       these cases, making sure it pointed to the correct places on
       the stack for us.

  </li><li> Because of number 4, that caused problems with how we saved and
       restored context.  We solved this by fixing problem 4.
  </li></ol>

</li><li> I could run tasks initially, but they would not work the second
time they were called.  I discovered that the section of code in my
dispatcher that saves the context was not being executed.  The cmp
instrution, followed by a jump if 0, was incorrectly set.  It would
jump every time to the code to restore the other task, but skip the
code to save the old.  I was did not know the compare was not a word
compare.  when I changed it from cmp byte [bp+4],1 to cmp byte
[bp+5],1 it worked.

</li><li> I was careless about parts of the code where interrupts were
re-enabled.  I had to re-check all my functions to ensure that none
were re-enabling them unless it was absolutely necessary.  Before I
did this, the code would work great most of the time but it had
desultory stalls.  When the tick was set to 1000, it could aggravate
it.  It would also only call task C after a while.  One I made sure
the interrupts were correctly set it worked fine.

</li><li> The global variables declared in the header had duplicate copies.
I just consolidated the functions that needed those vars into one
file.

</li><li> In delay task, when we moved a node from one list to another, we
   started traversing the wrong list in our while loop. (temp-&gt;next no
   longer pointed to the next node in the delayed list, but in the
   ready list).  Solution: save the temp-&gt;next pointer before changing
   lists.

</li><li> We forgot to disable interrupts when we were dealing with lists,
   and sometimes a task would disappear.  Surround anything dealing
   with the lists with Enter and ExitMutex().

</li><li> When we removed a task we would accidentdly move down the
ready list instead of the delayed list, and only one task could run
per tick.

</li><li> We didn't know before that we would need to save the bp.

</li><li> We first had problems ascertaining exactly when and where we were
to save context.  After deciding that, we then spent the rest of our
debugging time just working out the actual implementation of the
saving and restoring of the context.  We did not suffer from
compilation errors, but our run-time errors were always related to
improper saving of the context.  Our biggest challenge was
understanding the status of the stack with respect to function calls
and the pointer bp.

</li><li> The major problem we had was incorrectly using global variables
and missunderstanding how function calls are pushed onto the stack.

</li><li> The only major problem we ran into was that our code was not
optimized so that it operated correctly at 1,000 ticks.  It worked
perfect down to about 2500 but we had to re-write our sorting
algorithm in order for it to work with the 1000. Another problem we
ran into was with our saving of context.  We eventually realized that
on our stack we had two different return IP's.  One for the actual
task that was running and another for the function that had called
YKSaveContext...YKScheduler.

</li><li> Another problem we encountered was making sure the YKISRCallDepth
got incremented and decremented properly in the various situations
(ISR interrups -&gt; return to previoussly running task, ISR interrupts
-&gt; return to higher priority task, etc.)  The solution to this problem
just involved looking at all the possible cases and making sure our
code handled them right.

</li><li> We had the hardest time with the assembly language and using it
to save context and restore context correctly.  We weren't saving the
stack pointer in the right place in the TCB and we weren't returning
from a function correctly.  It also had to do with not understanding
how the stack was working entirely.

</li><li> Our dispatcher, which saves and restores context for us, was not
written following c-calling conventions.  Therefore, when we saved our
context it went to a location in memory that was unexpected.

</li><li> After we saved the context we failed to update the stack pointer
in our TCB.  Of course this meant that we couldn't find our context
later when it was needed for task restoration.
 
</li><li> We passed a parameter to the dispatcher informing it if it was
being called from a task or an ISR.  If it was from an ISR then we
didn't save the context, since the ISR would have already done this.
We set this flag in the YKDelayTask() function.  When our idle task
was preempted by the scheduler, control would never pass to
YKDelayTask(), and therefore the ISR flag would be kept set from the
last time it was set.  When the dispatcher was called it thought it
was coming off an ISR, when in reality the previous context was the
idle task.  So, the context of the idle task wouldn't get saved.  This
was our most difficult and subtle bug, by far.  We spent about 3 hours
searching for it, and would have spent much more time on it if
[another student} hadn't pointed out that he had had such a bug.  We
fixed it and the program worked after that.

</li><li> We used a linked list to keep track of our TCB's, but we
forgot\didn't understand that a pointer in C merely holds an
address--not space for the parameters.  Because of this, our TCB's
were getting initialized with wrong values.  We solved this by
creating an array of TCB's to allocate the space necessary.  Our other
main problem was a fuzzy understanding of saving and restoring context
and how the dispatcher transfers control to the task.  When we talked
to the TA and finally understood how saving and restoring context and
the dispatcher work, we were able to rewrite our dispatcher and pass
off the lab in a couple of hours.

</li><li> Some of the problems encountered: calling the scheduler from the
tickhandler; setting up the save context and saving the appropriate
return IP for the pseudo Iret was also a challenge.

</li><li> In our YKNewTask we didn't figure out correctly the number of
bytes that we needed to allocate for saving our context.  Because of
this, our CS was set to our IP and our IP was set to 0 so when we
dispatched the task it tried to execute the instruction in address:
CS:IP which didn't exist.  The other big "bug" was that we were not
updating our TCBsp every time we saved the context for the task. so
every time the task was dispatched, our TCBsp was set to the initial
value that we had given to it in YKNewTask.

</li><li> We were trying to get fancy with our context saving and
restoring.  Specifically, we were trying to save and restore context
outside of the dispatcher. We re-worked our strategy to save and
restore the context from inside the dispatcher, and we wrote multiple
dispatchers to deal with three cases: When we launch the first task
from the main, when we switch from a running task to a task that was
never run before, and when we switch from a running task to a task
that has been run before. Things worked then.

</li><li> We tried making our YKEnterMutex and YKExitMutex too smart. They
were keeping track of enable and disable requests in an attempt to not
allow the user to inadvertently re-enable interrupts when the program
has had two disable requests in a row previously (nested interrupt
disabling and enabling). Since interrupts may be enabled with "iret"
outside of the control of the YKEnterMutex and YKExitMutex functions,
our "smartness" was, um, outsmarted. In short, we just figured out
manually where it would be safe to re-enable interrupts from the
context of our kernel implementation. Since the kernel is so small,
this was not difficult.

</li><li> Our first problem was that in our dispatcher, we were overwriting
bp when restoring context, and we couldn't fetch our ip to go to the
next instruction.  Our other major problem was that we weren't saving
our sp in our ISR assembly code.

</li><li> The major problems we ran into were putting the end of interrupt
code in the wrong place.  We updated the TCB's stack pointer every
time we went into an interrupt.  But we only want update it when we go
into the first interrupt.  Also we had some problems when we had
interrupts enabled when the scheduler was running.

</li><li> We did not correctly update the pointer to the current task.  This resulted in our blocked task list becoming a circular list, cycling on the first item in the list, as we kept trying to add the same one to the list.</li>

<li>Because we were making a call to the dispatcher as a function, the stack pointer was in the wrong place. The stack pointer was referencing points in the function call, instead of somewhere we could restore context to safely.

</li><li> We had to decide when to enter and exit the mutex.  We were
returning from the dispatcher to the scheduler after an IRET for
restoring the context, and, if we were entering back into the idle
task it would hang.  To fix this problem we had to put the mutex into
an else statement if it entered into the dispatcher.

</li><li> We had difficulty initializing a stack when the task was first
created.  We finally created a function in assembly.  This function
was passed the task pointer and the taskstack pointer.  We then pushed
on fake flags, the CS, then the task pointer onto the taskstack.
Finally we pushed on 9 dummy registers containing 0's and returned the
SP to the calling funcion, which, in turn, saved it in the TCB.

</li><li> We originally wrote several different dispatchers to handle the
different cases, but in the end, we just wrote one, and made all
context pushes appear as if they were pushed by an interrupt. 

</li><li> We failed to include clib.s as the first item when running
cat. This led to all kinds of weird bugs until we corrected it.

</li><li> When returning a task to the ready list from the delayed list, we
would sometimes skip checking the state of one of the delayed tasks at
the end of the list. This was because we moved to the next item in the
list even if we removed an item. Changing the code to an if-else
solved this problem.
 
</li><li> Stack overflow: We were not setting the stack pointer quite
correctly, so each time a task was delayed, 2 words of garbage
remained on the stack. After a few hundred ticks, the stack would
overflow and overwrite other code. Correctly removing all necessary
items from the stack in the dispatcher solved this problem.

</li><li> Setting stack pointer: originally we forgot to supply the
starting stack pointer for each task when it was launched. The task
stack pointer then looked like the system stack pointer at a really
high address like FFE0. Setting the initial task stack pointer to the
value *taskstk passed into YKInitialize solved this problem.
 
</li><li> In setting up our initial context we had major problems because
we were pushing the program bp instead of the bp for the taskstack.
So we had a bp value of FFFF.  Another one of our problems was that we
were checking for which return type to use based on the function that
called the interupt instead of what type of function was called to
stop the task.  We also would over run our stack with really deep
nested interupts so we had to fix that.  Most of the otherbugs we had
were based on having the wrong sp or bp or number of things on the
stack.
</li>

<li> Symptom: Returning to the wrong place. Some other problems were: We
wrote functions to save context, but they wouldn't return to the right
place because the RET instruction would pop off the wrong address from
the stack.  So we just copied the code instead of calling some generic
function to save and restore context.  The next problem was that our
ENTERISR updated the stack frame so that we could pop the context off
at the end of the dispatcher.  Unfortunately since it was a function
call, the stack frame was off by two bytes and we would return to
whatever our flags were pointing to.  </li>

<li>The TICK handler was that it wasn't updating the delayed list correctly.</li>
</ul>
