<title>The uC/OS real-time kernel</title>

<h2>The uC/OS real-time kernel</h2>

Developed by Jean Labrosse, uC/OS is a portable, ROMable, preemptive,
real-time multitasking kernel for microprocessors.  Most of the kernel
is written in C, allowing it to be ported to new microprocessor
platforms in a straightforward way.  (You must rewrite the minimal
assembly language routines.)  The kernel manages up to 63 user tasks,
with performance comparable to many commercially available kernels.<p>

The source code to uC/OS is available on the CD included with your
text and can be used without restriction in classes and academic
projects.  (Commercial usage requires an appropriate license from
Labrosse.)  While we will not run this kernel, you are welcome to
study the source code to help in the design of your own kernel.  For
your convenience, it is available online in the /ee2/ee425/src/uCOS
directory.<p>

Additional notes about uC/OS and its structure will be added here as
needed. <p>

Be aware that those machine-specific portions of the source code in
our distribution run on an x86 platform. <p>
