<h2> Setting Your Path </h2>

When you type a command, Linux examines a specific set of directories
in a specific order to find an executable file of that name.  This set
of directories is called your <i> search path</i>.  All of the Linux
tools you will be using for this class are found in
/ee2/ee425/bin/linux, a location that your path would not normally
include, so you need to change it explicitly.  <p>

If you cannot access the /ee2 directory when you log in to the Linux
machines, the system probably knows you are part of the "caedm"
organization only, and not part of the "ee" organization.  If you
can't see the /ee2 files ("cd /ee2" gives a response something like
"No such file or directory") let the instructor know via email and
he'll have the sysops change your account info.<p>

The simplest way to make a single change that will work all semester
is to edit the .cshrc file (or your .bashrc file if you use the bash
shell) in your home directory.  In it you should find lines that looks
something like this (with potentially a lot more entries, such as
/usr/bin, /usr/lib/, etc.): 

<blockquote> 
<pre> set path = (. $path /usr/local/bin) </pre>
</blockquote>

Similar lines may appear several times in your .cshrc or .bashrc
file. If you know which one of these lines you need to modify, simply
append /ee2/ee425/bin/linux to the end of the set path statement. For
example, you would change the example above to: 

<blockquote>
  <p><samp>set path = (. $path /usr/local/bin /ee2/ee425/bin)</samp></p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you are not sure which line you should edit, the easiest way to add the
ECEn425 tools to your path is to add the following line at the very end of your .cshrc
file:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><samp>set path = ($path /ee2/ee425/bin/linux)</samp></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This will append the linux tools directory to your current
path. Once you have changed your .cshrc or .bashrc file, simply save
it.  Any terminal windows you start after the file has been edited
should see the change to your path and be able to find the tools.  To
make the change take effect in any windows already open, type
"<samp>source ~/.cshrc"</samp>.</p>
