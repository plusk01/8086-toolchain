<h2> Setting Your Path </h2>

When you type a command, the shell you are running examines a specific
set of directories in a specific order to find an executable file of
that name.  This set of directories is called your <i> search
path</i>.  All of the tools you will be using for this class are found
in /ee2/ee425/bin, a location that your path would not normally
include, so you need to change it explicitly.  <p>

If you cannot access the /ee2 directory when you log in to the ECEn
"Spice" machines (in 425 CB), the system probably knows you are part
of the "caedm" organization only, and not part of the "ee"
organization.  If you can't see the /ee2 files ("cd /ee2" gives a
response something like "No such file or directory") let the
instructor know via email and he'll have the sysops change your
account info.<p>

You can change the path each time you login, or you make a single
change to an initialization file in your home directory for your shell
that will work all semester.  The syntax for this depends on the shell
you are using.  Popular shells include bash (GNU's Bourne Again
Shell), tcsh (T shell), and csh (C shell).

<h3> tcsh and csh </h3>

The command you want here is along these lines:
<blockquote>
  <p><samp>set path = ($path /ee2/ee425/bin)</samp></p>
</blockquote>
This will append the directory with the class tools to the end of your
current search path (the value of $path).  Typing this at the prompt
will make a change for your current session.  To make a one-time
change for the entire semester, insert the above line near the end of
your .cshrc file.  Make sure you add the line after all other lines
in the file that reference the path variable.
<p>

Once you have changed your .cshrc file, simply save it to disk.  Any
terminal windows you start after the file has been edited should see
the change in your .cshrc file and be able to find the tools.  To make
the change take effect in any windows already open, type "<samp>source
~/.cshrc"</samp>.</p>


<h3> bash </h3>

Use the command 
<blockquote>
  <p><samp>export PATH=$PATH:/ee2/ee425/bin</samp></p>
</blockquote>
To make a permanent change, add the above line near the end of your
.bashrc file. <p>
