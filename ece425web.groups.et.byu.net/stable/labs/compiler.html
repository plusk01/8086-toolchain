<h2>The lccsimp compiler</h2>

The compiler used to compile C programs for the SIMP platform is
/ee/ee425/bin/lccsimp, which can be executed by typing "lccsimp -S
file.c" after setting your <A HREF="path.html"> path</A>.  The "-S"
option is required; it instructs the compiler to produce assembly
language output. <p>

The lccsimp compiler was created by writing a SIMP code generator for
the lcc compiler, a readily available, retargetable, ANSI C
compiler. lcc was created by Christopher Fraser and David Hanson and
is described in detail in their excellent book <i>A Retargetable C
Compiler: Design and Implementation</i>, published by
Benjamin/Cummings. <p>
