<h2>User-friendly Linux hints</h2>

Once you've tried the following features, you won't be able to live
without them.  They are typically not part of the default account.
<b>You will definitely want to use these features these semester as
you design and debug your code.</b>  The TAs will expect that you have
followed these suggestions when they help you.<p>

<ul>
<li><b>Scroll bars in xterms</b>.  Tired of not being able to scroll
back the screen in an xterm? Here's the fix.
<ol>
<li>Edit your .Xdefaults file located in your home directory. If this
file doesn't exist, create it!
<li> Add the following two lines to the end of this file:
<pre>
    xterm*scrollBar:        true
    xterm*saveLines:        2048
</pre>
<li> Save the file and exit the text editor you used to edit the file.
<li> Logout and log back in again to see the changes.
</ol><p>

<li><b>Command history and tab completion</b>.  Tired of typing in the
same commands over and over again at the unix prompt? You need command
history & tab complete.
<ol>
<li>rlogin to any et machine. Example- rlogin naples.et.byu.edu
<li>execute the following command:
<pre>
    chsh <username> /usr/local/bin/tcsh
</pre>

<li>Exit your rlogin shell. After 5-10 minutes, if you relogin, all
your xterm windows will be running tcsh. tcsh allows you use the arrow
keys (or CTR-P for previous and CTR-N for next) to scroll through the
list of all the past commands you have executed.  It also provides tab
complete. By typing in a filename partway, hitting tab will
automatically complete it for you. :) NICE!
</ol><p>

<li> <b>Display full path at command prompt</b>. Tired of the % as
your command prompt? Wish you knew which directory you were in?  Do
this:

<ol>
<li>open the .cshrc file located in your home directory in a text editor.
<li>locate the following lines in your .cshrc file:
<pre>
## Set prompt
if (`whoami` == root) then
  set prompt            = "`hostname`# "
else
  set prompt            = "`hostname`% "
endif
</pre>

<li> Change the above lines to match this:
<pre>
if (`whoami` == root) then
   set prompt   = "`hostname`# "
else
   set prompt   = "`hostname`:`pwd`>"
endif
</pre>

<li> Add the following line to the end of your .cshrc file:
<pre>
alias cd 'cd \!*;set prompt="`hostname`:`pwd`> "'
</pre>

<li> Save and exit the file.  Logout and log back in again to see the
changes.
</ol><p>

<li> <b>Viewing files</b>. If the file is short, use <i>cat</i> to view the file.
If the file is long, use <i>less</i> (or <i>more</i>) to view the file.<p>

Examples:
<pre>
cat .login
less .cshrc
</pre><p>

<li> <b>Adding your current directory to your PATH</b>.  When you
compile any C program, it creates an executable you can run. If you
are in the current directory where the executable is located, you
should be able to just type in the name of the executable to get it to
run. If this doesn't work in your environment, it is because your
current working directory is not in your PATH. To add this to your
path do the following:

<ol>
<li> edit your .cshrc file located in your home directory
<li> at the bottom of the file, add this line:
<pre>	
    setenv PATH .:$PATH
</pre>
<li> logout and back in again to see the change, or type "source .cshrc"
to see it immediately.
</ol><p>

<li> <b>Tips to stay organized</b>.  I'd recommend making a separate
directory for each class you are writing labs for. Inside each
directory, make another directory for each lab.  This will keep you
organized and allow you to keep track of each lab for each class with
ease. Use mkdir to make the directories, use cd to change directory to
run and edit your files from inside these directories.
</ul>
