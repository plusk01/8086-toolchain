<li> Problem 6.4 from the text. To clarify, the code is attempting
to use semaphores to protect access to the shared variable
<samp>iRecordCount</samp>.<p>

<li> Problem 6.5 from the text. <p>

<li> Write a short C program that includes a switch statement matching
an integer variable against at least eight consecutive integer
constants with distinct actions for each case. It should have the
following form:
<pre>
switch (i) {
    case 0: actions_0; break;
    case 1: actions_1; break;
    case 2: actions_2; break;
    case 3: actions_3; break;
    case 4: actions_4; break;
    case 5: actions_5; break;
    case 6: actions_6; break;
    case 7: actions_7; break;
    default: actions_d; break;
}
</pre>
where <i> actions_i </i> is an short sequence of C statements. Compile
the program using the ECEn 425 tools and study the resulting .s file.  Describe
in detail the mechanism used to implement the flow of control through
the switch statement.
<p>

Write another C program that includes the switch statement again but this
time have it match
an integer variable against eight randomly chosen integer
values (that you choose) between 0 and 1000.  Compile the program
and study the resulting .s file.  Describe in detail the
mechanism used to implement the flow of control through the switch
statement.  <p>

Compare and contrast the two implementations of switch statements
that you discovered above.  How are they different, and why are they
different?  On the basis of what you've seen can there be significant
differences in overhead between switch statements that appear similar at
the source code level?  What lesson should a programmer learn from
this?
<p>
