<li> Problem 6.7 from the text. <p>

<li> Problem 6.9 from the text. Explain your answer.<p>

<li>
Suppose mutual exclusion in a simple operating system is provided by
calling the synchronization primitives <strong> acquire </strong> and
<strong> release</strong>, corresponding to routines that our text
refers to as wait (pend) and signal (post) respectively.  Both are
called with a single binary semaphore as argument.  The acquire
function, when called, will return only when the specified semaphore
is available and was successfully acquired; it busy-waits until the
semaphore is available.  The release routine simply updates the
semaphore to indicate that it is now available.  <p>

Any implementation of acquire and release should provide the desired
operation for even for the most pathological sequences and timings of
events. An incorrect implementation may be manifest in a variety of
ways, including deadlock of multiple tasks, calls to acquire never
returning, semaphore values becoming inconsistent, etc.  <p>

Suppose further that the operating system is intended to run on both
uniprocessor and multiprocessor platforms, so mutual exclusion must be
supported in some way other than disabling interrupts.  This problem
explores two alternative implementations. <p>
<ol type="a">
<li> Most instruction sets include special instructions that can be
used for synchronization.  Example instructions include
<em>test-and-set</em> and other <em>read-modify-write</em>
operations.  In general, suitable instructions combine a read of
a memory location with a modification to that location as
an <em>atomic</em> or indivisible operation.  <p>

Identify one instruction implemented in any processor in the x86
family that could be used for synchronization.  (Feel free to use any
documentation you have access to, online or otherwise.)  Describe how
you could use this instruction to implement efficient acquire and
release routines.<p>

<li>Suppose you are targeting a CPU with no special instructions for
synchronization.  The following code has been proposed as a software
implementation of acquire and release:<p>

<pre>
struct semaphore
{
    int val[NUMPROCS];    /* 1 entry for each processor */
    int lastid;           /* ID of last processor to get semaphore */
};

int procid;               /* processor ID, unique per processor */

void init(struct semaphore *sem)
{                         /* called once at beginning of execution */
    int i;
    for (i = 0; i < NUMPROCS; i++)
        sem->val[i] = 0;
    sem->lastid = 0;
}

void acquire(struct semaphore *sem)
{
    /* assume procid holds ID of processor running this code */
    int i, j, first;
  loop:
    first = sem->lastid;
    sem->val[procid] = 1;
  forloop:
    for (i = first; i < NUMPROCS; i++)
    {
        if (i == procid)
	{
	    sem->val[i] = 2;
	    for (j = 0; j < NUMPROCS; j++)
	        if (sem->val[j] == 2 && j != procid)
		    goto loop;
	    sem->lastid = procid;
	    return;      /* success!  */
	}
	else if (sem->val[i])
	    goto loop;
    }
    first = 0;
    goto forloop;
}

void release(struct semaphore *sem)
{
    sem->lastid = (procid+1) % NUMPROCS;    /* reset to next processor */
    sem->val[procid] = 0;
}
</pre>
<p>

Does this implementation of acquire and release actually work? If not,
show a situation in which it malfunctions.  If it does work, describe
the approach taken by the algorithm to guarantee mutual exclusion.<p>
