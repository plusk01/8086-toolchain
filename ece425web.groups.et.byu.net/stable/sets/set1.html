Some of the following questions ask you to provide code. You are
expected to compile and run the code and make sure it works before you
submit it.  You may use the C compiler and machine of your choice.  <OL>

<LI> Write a short C function named IsLeapYear() to determine if a
given year (passed into the function as an int parameter) is a leap
year; if it is, the value 1 is to be returned, otherwise the function
should return zero. A year is a leap year if it is divisible by 4 but
not by 100, with the exception that years divisible by 400 are leap
years.<p>

<LI> Consider the following code fragment:<p>

<pre>
int x = 10;
int y = 3;
float result;

result = x / y;
</pre><p>

By inspection, what value do you expect <b> result </b> to have after
the assignment? Add what you need to compile and run this code and to
output the value of <b>result</b> after the assignment (use the
compiler of your choice).  Does <b> result </b> actually end up with
the value you expected?  Explain why <b> result </b> is assigned this
value.<p>

<LI> Assume t1 and t2 are defined to be 32-bit ints and that t1 has
been assigned an arbitrary value.  Write a single line of C code which
assigns t2 a value determined from t1 as described below. (The single
line of code should set all four bytes of t2 as specified below.)
Assume that bytes are 8 bits, that byte1 refers to the highest-order
byte, byte2 to the next highest byte, etc.  Run your code to make sure
it actually works before you submit it.<p>

<ul>
<li> byte1 of t2 is to be set to byte2 of t1
<li> byte2 of t2 is to be set to the bitwise complement of byte1 of t1
<li> byte3 of t2 is to be set to byte4 of t1
<li> byte4 of t2 is to be set to byte3 of t1
</ul><p>

<LI> In the expressions given below, assume that <b> x</b>, <b> y</b>,
and <b> z</b> are integers with the values 0, 1, and 2 respectively.
For each expression, give the resulting value of the expression and
show how it is evaluated.  To show how it is evaluated, add
parentheses to the original expression until all ambiguity is
eliminated (e.g., "<samp>a+b/c-d</samp>" would become
"<samp>((a+(b/c))-d)</samp>").  Be sure to give the final value of
each expression.
<p>

<pre>
a. x + y * z
b. x == 0 && y != 4
c. y < x < z
d. y+-z
e. !z||y
f. y ? x : z
g. x - y < z
h. x = 0 || z <= y  <!--Old: x = 1 && z >= y --> (Give value of expression and final value of x)
i. z & 3 == 2
</pre>


</OL>
