<OL>
<LI> Problem 4.1 from the text. Explain your answer.<p>

<li> Problem 4.2 from the text. Assume that the code "<samp>return
(lSecondsToday)</samp>" is implemented such that it reads
lSecondsToday from the least significant word (or byte) to the most
significant word (or byte). Explain your answers.<p>

<li> Problem 4.3 from the text.<p>

<li>Consider the following C function in which the function body has been omitted:
<blockquote><pre>
void MyFunction(int argWord, char argByte)
{
    int localWord;
    char localByte;

    ...
    ...
    ...
}
</pre></blockquote>
<ol type="a">

<li>Write working 8086 assembly that would be used to make the
function call "<samp>MyFunction(1, 2);</samp>". (Hint: This includes
pushing the arguments onto the stack and cleaning up the stack after
the call)

<li>How would the compiler reference each of the variables
<samp>argWord</samp>, <samp>argByte</samp>, <samp>localWord</samp> and
<samp>localByte</samp> in assembly? (Hint: For example, one of them
might be referenced by "<samp>word [bp-2]</samp>". Be careful on
<samp>localByte</samp>.)

<li><i>How</i> and <i>where</i> is space allocated for the local
variables <samp>localWord</samp> and <samp>localByte</samp>?

</ol>
<p>

<li>
<i> Make </i> is a very useful tool on Unix systems that you will
be required to use in future assignments.  Make provides
support to maintain programs based on multiple source files that you
won't be able to live without once you've used it.  You provide make
with a file specifying file dependencies and also the actions required
to update targets if any of the files have changed on which the target
is dependent.  <p>

Here is a sample makefile:
<blockquote><pre>
CC = cc
CFLAGS = -g
OBJ = src1.o src2.o src3.o

prog1:	$(OBJ)
	$(CC) $(CFLAGS) $(OBJ) -o prog1

src1.o:	ops.h def.h src1.c

src2.o:	ops.h def.h src2.c

src3.o:	ops.h def2.h src3.c
</pre></blockquote>

Learn about what make does when called with the above makefile by
talking to classmates and TAs, reading the man page for
make, <font color=red>using your favorite search engine</font>, and
experimentation. <font color=red>(Be careful here, as make is smart
enough to use implicit rules for updating files when it is pretty
obvious what needs to be done. Read and experiment.)</font>  After you
understand what it does, write a description of make's actions when
run with the above makefile. Write your description in pseudo-code.
I'll define this loosely as a mixture of C and English of your own
devising that uses the structure of C to avoid ambiguity and English
for convenience in expressing high-level conditions and actions.  Here
is an example of acceptable pseudo-code:

<pre><blockquote>
if (you'd like to come && you have time)
   come to the class BBQ at my house;
else
   don't worry about it but you'll miss the fun;
</pre></blockquote>
