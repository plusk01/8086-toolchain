Changes made to the SciTech project

**** May 9, 2002 *****
At this point the directory structure included the whole SciTech emulator 
archive

- Copied files:
	include/x86emu.h to src/x86emu
	include/x86emu/types.h,regs.h,fpu_regs.h to src/x86emu/x86emu

- Added defintions:
	#define u16 unsigned short
	#define u32 unsigned long
  to file src/x86emu/x86emu/debug.h

- Added definitions:
	#define ulong unsigned long
	#define uint unsigned int
  to files: src/x86emu/x86emu/debug.h, src/x86emu/validate.c

- Eliminated all sections that compile when __HAVE_INLINE_ASSEMBLER__ is 
  defined in all files in the src/x86emu directory. This includes the 
  #if  defined(__HAVE_INLINE_ASSEMBLER__) && !defined(PRIM_OPS_NO_REDEFINE_ASM)
  section in prim_ops.h since no assember directives will be used.
  (used VC file search to find references)

- Eliminated file prim_asm.h from project. This file implements Watcom C 
  inline assembly for speed.  (used VC file search)
  
- Removed the validate.c file. This file is used as a test program and only
  works on an x86 machine with inline assembler. It checks the inline 
  assembler results to the c version results to ensure correctness of the 
  emulation.
  
- Found that the u15, u32, defenitions were in src/x86emu/x86emu/types.h
  Added the ulong and uint defentions to this file and removed them from
  src/x86emu/x86emu/debug.h and src/x86emu/validate.c.
  
- Renamed X86EMU_sysEnv struct entry from "void* private" to "void* privatvp"
  in regs.h to ensure c++ compatibility. This entry does not appear to be 
  referenced by name anywhere in the code (?????)
  
- NOTE: At this point everything compiled fine with 20 warnings dealing with
  type size and mismatches. I then examined the warinings one by one.

- Almost all the warnings had to do with bitwise operations on short values.
  Aparently when you do a bitwise operation VC assumes the result is no a
  short (stupid eh?) so I added type casts to eliminate the warnings.
  These warnings only affected ops2.c
    
- Function abs(int) referenced in prim_ops.c wasn't defined. Added #include 
  <stdlib.h> to list of libraries in the project enclude file "x86emui.h".
  
- The remaining errors had to do with minus operations (subtract,negate) on
  signed numbers and a < comapre sign mismatch. Those, I assume, are there
  for a reason and I did not change them.

- Renamed all files to .cpp to ensure c++ compatibility.

- It's clear that the designers wanted to make this code compatible with c++
  but that they never tested it with a c++ compiler. Had to make the following
  TWO changes to make c++ compatibility:
  
1 Changed printk statement in ops2.cpp for to allow for operand that's
  supposed to dissapear in c++ mode: search for "X86EMU_UNUSED(op2,)
 
2 Redefined sys.cpp globabl function pointers to be extern "C". This matches
  the declarations in x86emui.h. Otherwise the compiler didn't recognize them
  as being the same functions.


**** May 9, 2002 *****

- Determined that validate.c and prim_asm.h weren't needed and they were
  placed in a filder named "Not Needed Files". debug.c is only needed when 
  in debug mode.
